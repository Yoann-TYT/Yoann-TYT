### Hi there 👋

As a #freelance #PHP, Symfony and APIPlatform developer, I'm passionate about building strong and scalable backend solutions for businesses of all sizes. Thanks to my skills in #PHP and #Symfony, I have developed an expertise in creating web applications using modern frameworks, which allows me to deliver quality projects on time. 🎉 

Moreover, I have also acquired a solid experience in building RESTful APIs through the use of APIPlatform, which allows me to provide backend solutions that are adaptable and easily integrated with other applications or services. ⚙️

When it comes to mobile development, I choose to use Flutter as the main framework for my projects. This allowed me to build native apps for both iOS and Android operating systems 📱, providing a smooth and consistent user experience across all devices.

In summary, my skills in backend development with PHP, Symfony and APIPlatform, as well as in mobile with Flutter, allow me to offer quality solutions as a freelance developer. I am passionate about creating robust and adaptable solutions, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to put my skills into practice 🚀.
